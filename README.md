This is the Notebookinator, a [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) template designed for the Vex Robotics Competition. This template aims to make it as easy as possible to get you up and running with a clean and organized notebooking environment, with minimal overhead. It provides multiple themes, and can even be extended with your own.
