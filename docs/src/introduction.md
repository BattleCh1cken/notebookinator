# Introduction

Welcome to the Notebookinator, a Typst package meant to simplify the notebooking
process for the Vex Robotics Competition. Its theming capabilities handle all of
the styling for you, letting you jump right into writing documentation.

While it was designed with VRC in mind, it could just as easily be used for
other competitor systems such as the First Robotics Competition and the First
Tech Challenge.
