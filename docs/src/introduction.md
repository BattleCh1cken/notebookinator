# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the notebookinator, a Typst package meant to simplify the notebooking process for the Vex Robotics Competition. Its theming capabilities handle all of the styling for you, letting you jump right into writing documentation.

While it was designed with VRC in mind, it could just as easily be used for other competitor systems such as the First Robotics Competition and the First Tech Challenge.

If you're new here, we recommend you read the [installation guide](./installation.md) and the [basic usage guide](./basic_usage.md).

If you already know what you're doing, and just some quick information, check out the [API reference](./reference.typ).

If you're an advanced user, and want to extend / contribute to the Notebookinator, check out our [developer documentation](./developer_documentation/developer_documentation.md).
